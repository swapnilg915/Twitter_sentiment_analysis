Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning algorithm CNN with Word2Vec

This project is on Twitter sentiment analysis. It is a solution for the problem statement on the Analytics vidya competetion.
It classifies the user tweets into 2 classes i.e hate speech and non hate speech.

I have solved this problem using Covolutional Nueral Networks algorithm . It gives very good accuracy and precision recall score. 

I would suggest to train this on GPU.

Requirements -
python 3
Tensorflow
keras
numpy
gensim
